# Hey I am Rachit Srivastava

I like experimenting with new technologies, building small projects, and occassionally joining hackathons. ✨

Here's a list of things I currently keep myself busy with:

* 🏻‍💻 Working as a full stack developer over at Icertis using ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET CORE, SQL, Front End Technologies.
* ☀️ Maintaining Letra, an open-source project I created (feel free to contribute, this is beginner friendly!)
* 🛠 Getting myself into different technology stacks. Trying out new technologies in my spare time.
